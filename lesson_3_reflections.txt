When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Remote repository helps sharing the project with target users, collaborating
with other programmers and simply
syncing between different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulling helps you to manage logic behind any changes and provides the
opportunity to leave your work hidden until it will become ready for pulling to
the public remote.
