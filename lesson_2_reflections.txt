What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the '.git' directory in the repository's directory and makes it
possible for you to commit the versions of your project. All of the initializing
procedure can be made offline.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Staging area provides an opportunity to complete the commits in different ways,
allowing you to add different files to a repository from your working directory
using different commits, not in a single one. Sometimes it can really help
to support logic behind your committing style.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

With staging area, we can use git diff, git diff --staged, git add commands to
make sure we have one commit per logical change. We may choose wisely which
files do we want to commit into the project repository.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches can help you organize the unsure, unready and experimental changes you
work on in your project, leaving the main (master) branch stable. Also it helps
organize different directions of the software design to merge them later back
into the main branch.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help a lot.
